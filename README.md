# auto-pilot

Execute C# code snippets (standalone *.cs files) from the terminal. No need to create a c# project with all the config files required or additional directory structures.

Super simple, yet super helpful when you don't want to be goofing around with complex Shell Scripting. Move all the hard parts to C# and then call your main() from the command line.
